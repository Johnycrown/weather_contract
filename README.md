**Weather Contract**
This is a smart contract written in Rust for interacting with an API to fetch weather data. It's built to run on the Internet Computer (ICP) platform.

**Overview**

This contract allows users to fetch weather data from an external API based on the provided city and country code. It utilizes the reqwest crate for making HTTP requests and serde_json crate for parsing JSON responses. The contract stores the fetched weather data in a local map for future retrieval.

**Contract Structure**

The contract consists of the following components:

**ContractState**: A struct defining the contract state, including the API key, city, and country code.
Weather: A struct representing weather data, including temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed.
WeatherContract: The main contract implementation, responsible for fetching weather data and storing it.
Functions

greet(name: String) -> String
Description: A simple greeting function that returns a personalized greeting message.
Parameters:
name: A string representing the name of the person to greet.
Returns: A string containing the greeting message.
fetch_weather_data(city: String, country_code: String, api_key: String)
Description: An asynchronous function to fetch weather data from an external API.
Parameters:
city: The name of the city for which to fetch weather data.
country_code: The country code of the city.
api_key: The API key required for accessing the weather API.
Behavior: Makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for the specified city and country code. If successful, parses the JSON response and stores the weather data in the local map.
get_weather_data(city: String, country_code: String) -> Option<Weather>
Description: Retrieves previously fetched weather data for a given city and country code.
Parameters:
city: The name of the city for which to retrieve weather data.
country_code: The country code of the city.
Returns: An optional Weather struct containing the weather data if available, or None if no data is found.
Storage

The contract uses a local map (WEATHER_MAP) to store weather data. The map key is a tuple (u64, String, String), where the first element is a unique identifier, and the second and third elements represent the city and country code, respectively. The value associated with each key is a Weather struct containing the weather data.

**Memory Management**

The contract utilizes thread-local memory management (MEMORY_MANAGER) to handle memory allocation and deallocation. It uses a virtual memory implementation (Memory) to manage memory resources effectively.

Usage

To interact with this contract, you can deploy it to the Internet Computer platform and call its exposed functions using the provided interface.

**Dependencies**

This contract relies on the following Rust crates:

candid: For Candid type definitions and serialization.
ic_stable_structures: For stable B-tree map implementation and memory management.
reqwest: For making HTTP requests to fetch weather data.
serde_json: For parsing JSON responses from the weather API.
Ensure that these dependencies are included in your project's Cargo.toml file before compiling the contract.
